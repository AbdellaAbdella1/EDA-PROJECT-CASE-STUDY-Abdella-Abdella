PROBLEM STATEMENT


In the realm of lending, companies encounter challenges in extending loans to individualswith insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Exploiting this situation, some consumersstrategically default on their loans.When a loan application reaches the company, critical decisions on loan approval hinge onthe applicant's profile. The bank's decision-making process involves two distinct risks:If the applicant demonstrates a high likelihood of repaying the loan, declining approval translates into a loss of potential business for the company.Conversely if the applicant is deemed unlikely to repay the loan, indicating a potential default, approving the loan may result in financial losses for the company. The delicate balance between these risks underscores the complexity of decision-making in the lending industry.


BUSINESS OBJECTIVES



The company's primary objective is to discern the key drivers or variables that strongly indicate the likelihood of loan default. This valuable insight can then be applied to enhance portfolio management and refine risk assessments.In this case study, the focus is on identifying patterns that serve as indicators of a client's potential difficulty in meeting installment payments. The knowledge gained from this analysis can guide strategic actions such as denying loans, adjusting loan amounts, or offering loans to riskier applicants at higher interest rates. The overarching goal is to ensure that applicants with the capability to repay t loan are not unfairly rejected.The core aim of this case study is to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to pinpoint and understand these indicators, facilitating the identification of applicants who may pose a higher risk of default. The analysis is executed using Python within a Jupyter notebook, underscoring the practical application of data-driven insights in the decision-making process.
